This configuration provides a modular starting point for anyone looking to use Neovim as an IDE. It’s designed to be simple, easy to understand, and highly extendable—you can use it as a complete setup or pick and choose individual components.

All included plugins are pinned to specific versions, ensuring compatibility and preventing unexpected updates from breaking your setup. With each new Neovim release, this repo will be updated alongside the community to stay current with the latest versions.

This setup is especially geared towards new Neovim users who want a familiar IDE-like experience. Its clean and straightforward structure makes it easy to add new plugins or customize existing ones.

## Install Neovim 0.11+

You can install Neovim with your package manager e.g. brew, apt, pacman etc.. bus remember that when you update your packages Neovim may be upgraded to a newer version.

If you would like to make sure Neovim only updates when you want it to than I recommend installing from source: [instructions](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim#install-from-source)

## Install the config

Make sure to remove or backup your current `nvim` directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ezra-1/Neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Run `nvim` and wait for the plugins to be installed

**NOTE** (You will notice treesitter pulling in a bunch of parsers the next time you open Neovim)

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```

You'll probably notice you don't have support for copy/paste also that python and node haven't been setup

So let's fix that

First we'll fix copy/paste

- On mac `pbcopy` should be builtin

- On Ubuntu

  ```sh
  sudo apt install xsel # for X11
  sudo apt install wl-clipboard # for wayland
  ```

Next we need to install python support (node is optional)

- Neovim python support

  ```sh
  pip install pynvim
  ```

- Neovim node support

  ```sh
  npm i -g neovim
  ```

We will also need `ripgrep` for Telescope to work:

- Ripgrep

  ```sh
  sudo apt install ripgrep
  ```

**NOTE** make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, I recommend a node manager like [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).

## Fonts

I recommend using the following repo to get a "Nerd Font" (Font that supports icons)

[getnf](https://github.com/ronniedroid/getnf)

**NOTE** Some are already setup as examples, remove them if you want
